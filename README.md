======

To populate PASTA GMN with legacy LTER Metacat DataONE MN objects.

The PASTA GMN (Generic Member Node) DataONE Member Node hosts science data packages generated by the Long Term Ecological Research Network, which are then synchronized and replicate to the DataONE Federation (www.dataone.org). Prior to the PASTA GMN, the LTER Network used a Metacat DataONE MN to host only science metadata. These science metadata objects need to be copied into PASTA GMN as real objects using the following pattern:
  1. If object exists on DataONE Coordinating Node (CN), copy object and system metadata from CN
  2. Otherwise, copy object and system metadata from Metacat MN.
  
gmnpop is a Python module for performing a copy of Metacat MN objects from either the DataONE CN or existing Metacat MN to PASTA GMN.
